= ServiceNow_CMDB Troubleshooting Guide

* <<Authentication>>

== Authentication

** Ensure that your credentials are properly set in the statemachine classes. Sometimes the password just needs to be re-entered.
** Ensure that you have sufficient privileges to perform CRUD operations.

<<top>>

== Connectivity

** Ensure that you can get to your ServiceNow instance from the CS server.

*** Try this command to ensure that you can return a JSON list of Linux CMDB records:

 curl -k -v -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" -u username:password -X GET https://your-instance.service-now.com/api/now/table/cmdb_ci_linux_server

NOTE: If this command is failing then it is possible that you will need a proxy server or your Service Now credentials do not have the necessary rights to view the records.

== Logging

** Check the /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log and /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/evm.log for errors.
